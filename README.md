## Recommendations

Based on the data I'd recommend that you launch your Kickstarter campaign between May and August. You could also consider lowering the Kickstarter goal for greater success, however there are 62 successful Kickstarter campaigns for US Plays with goals of $10,000 or higher. Out of these, 24 had goals equal to $10,000 with the highest count of success launched in August.
